# Enrichment Plugin Suite
**Author: Craig Freyman**

## User Enrichment Plugin
This suite of enrichment skills is designed to enhance security investigations by providing detailed insights into user activities, such as login behavior, password changes, MFA modifications, location analysis, mailbox activities, and IP-based sign-in tracking. By leveraging these tools, security teams can identify potential threats, monitor user risks, and respond to suspicious behavior effectively.

### FailedUserSignInSpecificDay
Identify failed sign-in attempts for a specific user over a defined lookback period. Provides insights into failed attempts, including timestamps, IP addresses, locations, and failure reasons.

**Example Prompt**: Identify failed sign-in attempts for mscott@paper.com in the last 7 days.

---

### EnhancedUserRiskAssessment
Combine user risk events, recent sign-ins, high-risk user indicators, and security alerts to deliver detailed context around risky user activities for a specific user. Supports threat detection, incident prioritization, and remediation planning.

**Example Prompt**: Fetch enhanced user risk details for mscott@paper.com.

### ImpossibleTravel
Detect impossible travel by analyzing login patterns and identifying logins from geographically distant locations within an unrealistically short time frame. Supports detection of potential credential misuse.

**Example Prompt**: Detect impossible travel events for mscott@paper.com in the past 7 days.

### SuspiciousMailboxActivities
Investigate recent mailbox activities to detect potential security threats, such as:
- Newly created or modified inbox rules that redirect or filter emails suspiciously.
- Mailbox permission changes that might indicate unauthorized access.
Focus on identifying anomalies that could lead to exfiltration or business email compromise (BEC) attempts.

**Example Prompt**: Investigate suspicious mailbox activities for mscott@test.com in the last 30 days.
