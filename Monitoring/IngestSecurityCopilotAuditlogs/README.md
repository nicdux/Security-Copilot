Technical community blog : [Monitor User Activities and System Events with Security Copilot](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/securitycopilotblog/monitor-user-activities-and-system-events-with-security-copilot-and-microsoft-se/4303368)

Auditing is a critical feature in any security solution, providing visibility into user activities and system events, detect usage and activities anomalies, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. By sending Copilot for Security audit logs into your cloud native SIEM - Microsoft Sentinel, users can gain deeper insights into their Security Copilot usage and take proactive measures to mitigate risks  

# Prerequisites  
### Enable the audit log capability in Security Copilot  
During the first run experience, a Security Administrator is given the option of opting into allowing Microsoft Purview to access, process, copy and store admin actions, user actions, and Copilot responses. For more information, see Get started with Security Copilot.  

Security Administrators can also access this option through the Owner settings page.  

Use the following steps to update the audit log settings:  

1. Sign in to Microsoft Security Copilot (https://securitycopilot.microsoft.com).  
2. Select the home menu icon.  
3. Navigate to the Owner settings > Logging audit data in Microsoft Purview.
