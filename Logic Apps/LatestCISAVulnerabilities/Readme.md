# Get the latest CISA vulnerabilities and check devices within my organization
Author: Jamil Mirza
This solution checks the latest CISA feed every 24 hours and queries the CVE finding against devices within Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Security Copilot will check for remediation actions and enrich the description. It will also tell you how many (if any) devices in your organization are vulnerable to the reported CVE. Finally, an email with the findings is submitted to a mailbox which can be edited after the install of the Logic App.
